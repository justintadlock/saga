# Saga

A tailor-made theme for writers by a published author and professional theme designer. Words are important to all writers. Getting those words to display beautifully on the screen can be a daunting task. Saga was created so that you could simply tell your story without worrying about the technical details. Aside from impeccable typography and attention to detail, the theme provides several easy-to-use customization options so you can personalize your site's design. It also integrates with the Literary plugin.

## Usage notes

Saga makes use of standard WordPress features and should require little instruction for standard usage.  However, some items should be noted.

* Featured images are only displayed if they are at minimum 1100px in width and 500px in height.  This is to maintain an aesthetic consistency throughout the theme.
* Inputting a social profile link in the Primary menu will automatically display an icon for the particular social network on the front end.
